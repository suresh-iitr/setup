  ## maximum duration before timing out write of the response
  # write_timeout = "10s"

  ## Maximum allowed http request body size in bytes.
  ## 0 means to use the default of 524,288,000 bytes (500 mebibytes)
  # max_body_size = "500MB"

  ## Part of the request to consume.  Available options are "body" and

  ## enable mutually authenticated TLS connections

  ## If the http header is not present on the request, no corresponding tag will be added
  ## If multiple instances of the http header are present, only the first value will be used

  ## Data format to consume.
